VolksForth is a 16bit Forth System produced by the german Forth
Gesellschaft e.V. Main development of this system was done between
1985 until 1989. The VolksForth Project was revived in 2005 with the
goal to produce a managable Forthsystem for computer systems with
restricted system resources.

Some modern Forth Systems were influenced by or were derived from
VolksForth (GNU-Forth, bigForth).

The current Version of VolskForth is 3.81. Work on Version 3.90 has
been started.

At this time VolksForth is available for this Systems:

 * VolksForth 6502 (Commodore 64, Commodore Plus 4, Atari 8bit, Apple I, Apple II)
 * VolksForth Z80 (CP/M, Schneider CPC CP/M)
 * VolksForth 68000 (Atari ST)

VolksForth is in work for this Systems:

 * VolksForth MS-DOS (Atari Portfolio)
 * VolksForth Z80 (Schneider CPC AMSDOS)
 * VolksForth 68000 (Mac Classic, Amiga)
