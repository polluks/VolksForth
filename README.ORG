#+Title: VolksForth Readme

VolksForth is a 16bit Forth System produced by the German Forth
Gesellschaft e.V.

Major development of this system was done between 1985 until 1989. The
VolksForth Project was revived in 2005 with the goal to produce a
managable Forthsystem for computer systems with restricted system
resources.

Some modern Forth Systems were influenced by or were derived from
VolksForth (GNU-Forth, bigForth).

The current Version of VolksForth is 3.81. Version 3.9.x will be
interim versions on the way to sync all VolksForth targets and move
towards compliance with the 2012 Forth standard.

Version 3.8.x is based on the Forth 83 standard, Version 4.00 will be
based on the current 2012 Standard (https://forth-standard.org).
